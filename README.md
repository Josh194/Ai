Version: 1.3.2

An open source neural network designed to give a visual into deep learning. Currently, this project only supports deep feed forward networks, but convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and other types will be added soon.

Features:
* Dynamic architecture
* Easy input through a text file
* Saving/Loading of networks through .xml files
* Realtime error graph for easy visualization
* Different activation functions
* Variable learning rate

New:
* New error graph with line simplification algorithm 
* Full support for multiple output neurons
* Neuron resizing based on layer size
* Fixed graph range
* Highlight selected connections
* Drag to create new connections
* Realtime input support
* Removed Thread.sleep() in feed loop, allowing the ai to run much faster
* Epoch counter
* + Other changes

Note:
If you are having problems giving the NN input, make sure your input file ends with a new line.
